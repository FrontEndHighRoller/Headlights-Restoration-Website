    <img src="photos/wash-headlights.png" alt="wash headlights">
    <p><strong>1. Clean the Headlights:</strong> <br>
    Start by thoroughly cleaning the headlights using a mild soap or automotive cleaner. Remove any dirt, grime, or debris that may have accumulated on the surface.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="diy-item">
    <img src="photos/sand-headlights.png" alt="sand headlights">
    <p><strong>2. Sand the Headlights:</strong><br>
    Gently sand the headlights using fine-grit sandpaper. Begin with a lower grit to remove any surface imperfections, then gradually move to a higher grit for a smoother finish. Avoid excessive sanding, as it can damage the headlights.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="diy-item">
    <img src="photos/polish-headlights.png" alt="polish headlights">
    <p><strong>3. Polish the Headlights:</strong><br>
    Apply a quality headlight polish to restore clarity and remove any remaining scratches. Use a clean microfiber cloth and apply the polish in a circular motion. Continue until the headlights regain their shine. Avoid using abrasive or harsh polishes that may further damage the headlights.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="diy-item">
    <img src="photos/seal-headlights.png" alt="seal headlights">
    <p><strong>4. Seal the Headlights:</strong><br>
    Protect the restored headlights by applying a UV-resistant sealant or clear coat. This will help prevent future yellowing and keep the headlights looking clear and vibrant. Avoid using sealants that are not specifically designed for automotive headlights, as they may not provide adequate protection.</p>

<section class="faq">

  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <button type="button" class="collapsibles">+ Why do headlights become cloudy, foggy or yellow?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Headlights are typically made of polycarbonate plastic, which can be affected by UV rays, environmental factors, and oxidation. This causes the headlights to become cloudy or yellowed over time.</p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsibles">+ How long can I expect the restored headlights to last?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Our restoration process is designed to provide long-lasting results. When headlights are restored by our team and receive proper maintenance, they can maintain their brand-new appearance for up to 4 years. Our restoration method, combined with regular care, ensures that your headlights stay clear, bright, and aesthetically pleasing for an extended period.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsibles">+ Is headlight restoration a permanent solution?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Headlight restoration is not a permanent solution, as headlights will eventually degrade over time due to environmental factors and UV exposure. However, regular maintenance and proper care can help prolong the results of the restoration.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsibles">+ How much time does it typically take to restore headlights?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Generally, DIY headlight restoration can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, depending on the specific restoration kit or method used. Professional headlight restoration services usually take around 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsibles">+ How much does headlight restoration cost?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The cost of headlight restoration (DIY or professional), depends on car model and headlights damage. DIY restoration can range from £30 to £50, while professional services typically cost between £65 to £120.</p>
  </div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsibles">+ Can headlight restoration remove scratches from headlights?</button>
  <div class="content">
